This is a console window game to help preschoolers associate number words with their numerical representations.
After your child answers a target number of questions correctly (target chosen by you), a browswer tab with cat
gifs on giphy.com will appear.

When prompted, you or your child will enter the child's name, the highest number he or she can count to, and the number
of questions that must be answered correctly to see the cat gifs.

Next, a random number word will be given, no greater than the highest number your child can count to. Read the number
aloud to your child and ask him or her to type it with the digt keys. Your child gets two chances to answer correctly
before a new random number is given.

After your child answers the target number of questions correctly, he or she can see the cat gifs by typing the word "cat".
If a different word is entered, a page of puppy gifs appears instead.
